OpenPhoto export tool for PicasaWeb

This will create .json description files for pictures of one of your
PicasaWeb albums, which will be suitable for the OpenPhoto importer.

To be able to connect to Picasaweb, you first should go to your google
account's parameters, and generate an application specific password :
 Account overview > Security > Authorising applications & sites >
 Generate a new application-specific password for this program, which
 will allow it to connect to PicasaWeb

This generated password will be provided with --app-password (along
with your google email passed to --login) to fetch.py.

Run the fetch.py tool once to fetch album ids, and then re-run it with
--album-id to fetch that album's photo .json descriptions in the
'fetched/' subdir

This is only a very early alpha, and no guarantee is made whatsoever.
